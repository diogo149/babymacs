** how to use
*** glossary
- frame :: a graphical system-level "window" (this is unfortantely quite confusing, since in emacs a window means something else)
- window :: a part of a frame which contains a buffer
- buffer :: contains the text to be editted - when you visit a file, the representation is stored in a buffer
- kill :: when talking about text, this means "cut"
- yank :: when talking about text, this means "paste"
- keybindings
  - =C-= :: control
  - =M-= :: meta (alt)
  - =S-= :: shift
  - =s-= :: super (eg. OS X command key)
  - examples:
    - =C-M-<up>= :: pressing control + alt + up at the same time
    - =C-x C-s= :: pressing control + x then control + s
    - =C-x k= :: pressing control + x then k (without control)
