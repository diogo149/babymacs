** how to use
*** glossary
- frame :: a graphical system-level "window" (this is unfortantely quite confusing, since in emacs a window means something else)
- window :: a part of a frame which contains a buffer
- buffer :: contains the text to be editted - when you visit a file, the representation is stored in a buffer
- kill :: when talking about text, this means "cut"
- yank :: when talking about text, this means "paste"
- keybindings
  - =C-= :: control
  - =M-= :: meta (alt)
  - =S-= :: shift
  - =s-= :: super (eg. OS X command key)
  - examples:
    - =C-M-<up>= :: pressing control + alt + up at the same time
    - =C-x C-s= :: pressing control + x then control + s
    - =C-x k= :: pressing control + x then k (without control)

| <escape> +       | balance the size of windows           |
| <escape> 0       | delete current window                 |
| <escape> 1       | delete all windows except current     |
| <escape> 2       | split window vertically               |
| <escape> 3       | split window horizontally             |
| <escape> 4       | split window into 4                   |
| <escape> <up>    | move up one logical (not visual) line |
| <escape> <down>  | move down one logical line            |
| <escape> <left>  | move to start of logical line         |
| <escape> <right> | move to end of logical line           |
| <escape> [       | begin recording macro                 |
| <escape> ]       | end recording macro                   |
| <escape> C-s     | switch project                        |
| <escape> C-f     | find file in project                  |

- make sure the environment (eg. virtualenv) you're using has the following packages:
  - jedi
